Haskell has some useful functions for dealing with lists:

$ ghci
GHCi, version 7.6.3: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
位 head [1,2,3,4,5]
1
位 tail [1,2,3,4,5]
[2,3,4,5]
位 init [1,2,3,4,5]
[1,2,3,4]
位 last [1,2,3,4,5]
5
Your job is to implement these functions in your given language. Make sure it doesn't edit the array; that would cause problems! Here's a cheat sheet:

| HEAD | <----------- TAIL ------------> |
[  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9,  10]
| <----------- INIT ------------> | LAST |

head [x] = x
tail [x] = []
init [x] = []
last [x] = x
Here's how I expect the functions to be called in your language:

head([1,2,3,4,5]); => 1
tail([1,2,3,4,5]); => [2,3,4,5]
=end

#My Solution
def head(x)
  return x[0]
end

def tail(x)
  x[1..-1]
end

def init(x)
  x[0..-2]
end

def last(x)
  return x[-1]
end

#Best Practise
def head(array)
  array[0]
end

def tail(array)
  array[1..-1]
end

def init(array)
  array[0..-2]
end

def last(array)
  array[-1]
end
